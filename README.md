</div> -->

- Welcome to keeby, where you can list your mechanical keyboard for sale, engage with others in the comments, and browse the best mechanical keyboards on the market. This site is built using the latest technologies, including React, Redux, and Flask, to ensure a seamless user experience.
</h3>

- One of the key features of keeby is its integration with cloud storage, allowing you to store your keyboard images and descriptions securely and easily via AWS S3. This makes it simple for you to list your keyboards for auction and for buyers to browse them without any hassle.

- I designed this site in a retro aesthetic, which is designed to evoke the nostalgia of classic keyboard designs while maintaining a modern, sleek appearance. So come explore keeby, the innovative platform that brings together keyboard enthusiasts from around the world to buy and sell their favorite mechanical keyboards!
